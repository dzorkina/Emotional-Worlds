#🌊 Emotional Worlds

Emotional Worlds is an interactive web project that combines Computer Science + Design + Interactivity.
The website allows users to type a short text, and an AI-based sentiment analyzer detects the emotional tone.
Based on the result, the site plays a matching video background + audio soundscape to create an immersive emotional experience.

🎯 Project Goals

Explore how AI sentiment analysis can interpret human emotions.
Show how multimedia environments (video + audio) influence perception and mood.
Build a functional demo version as a proof of concept.
